## About This Application

This interactive Shiny application allows users to compare different penalized estimation methods in statistical modeling. The app provides:

### **Key Features:**
- **Interactive Parameter Selection** - Adjust penalty parameters and compare results
- **Real-time Visualization** - See how different methods perform with your data
- **Method Comparison** - Side-by-side comparison of estimation techniques
- **Educational Tool** - Perfect for teaching penalized regression concepts

### **Supported Methods:**
- LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)
- Ridge Regression
- Elastic Net
- Adaptive LASSO
- SCAD (Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation)

### **Use Cases:**
- **Research** - Compare method performance on your datasets
- **Education** - Demonstrate penalized estimation concepts
- **Practice** - Hands-on learning with real statistical methods

### **Technical Details:**
- Built with R Shiny
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
