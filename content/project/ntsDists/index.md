## Overview

**ntsDists** is an R package that implements a variety of neutrosophic probability distributions. These distributions generalize classical statistical models by incorporating uncertainty, imprecision, and indeterminacyâ€”key components of neutrosophic theory.

This package enables users to:

- Compute the **Probability Density Function (PDF)**
- Evaluate the **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**
- Obtain values from the **Quantile Function**
- **Generate random samples** from neutrosophic distributions

It is a valuable tool for researchers working with data that includes vague or imprecise components.

## Installation

Install the package from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("ntsDists")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dmazarei/ntsDists")
```

## Quick Start

```r
library(ntsDists)

data(balls)
dnsNorm(x = balls, mean = c(72.14087, 72.94087), sd = c(37.44544, 37.29067))
pnsNorm(q = 5, mean = c(72.14087, 72.94087), sd = c(37.44544, 37.29067))
qnsNorm(p = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), mean = c(9.1196, 9.2453), sd = c(10.1397, 10.4577))
rnsNorm(n = 10, mean = c(4.141, 4.180), sd = c(0.513, 0.521))
```
