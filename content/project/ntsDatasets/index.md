## Overview

**ntsDatasets** is an R package that provides a collection of datasets designed for modeling and analysis with neutrosophic sets â€” a generalization of classical and fuzzy sets that accounts for indeterminacy.

This package supports the development and benchmarking of statistical methods that handle uncertainty and partial truth in data.

Install the package from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("ntsDatasets")
```

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("a-roshani/ntsDatasets")
```
