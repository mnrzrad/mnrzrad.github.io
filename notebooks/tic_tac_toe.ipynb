    "# üë®‚Äçüè´ Introduction to OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming means writing instructions for a computer to follow. These instructions are usually written as **functions**, which perform specific tasks like printing text or calculating a sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a programs get more complex, it's better to organize related data and functions **together**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **OOP** is a way to structure your code so that it models real-world entities using:\n",
    "- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects\n",
    "- **Objects**: Instances created from classes\n",
    "- **Methods**: Functions that are defined inside classes\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Data that belongs to the object\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß± What is a Class?\n",
    "A **class** is like a blueprint for creating something ‚Äî like how a blueprint for a car defines how to build it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects that bundle **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a class defines how to build an **object** ‚Äî a real thing in your program, like a game, a user, or a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "my_animal = animal(\"dog\")\n",
    "print(my_animal.name)  # Outputs: dog\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `animal` is the class.\n",
    "- `my_animal` is an object (an instance of the class).\n",
    "- `__init__()` is a **constructor** ‚Äî a special method that gets called automatically **when we create a new object from a class**.\n",
    "- `self.name` stores the name of each specific dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Understanding the `__init__()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an object from a class, Python calls a special method named `__init__`. This is known as the **constructor**.\n",
    "It is used to **initialize** the object‚Äôs attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside `__init__`, we set up the initial values of our object. The first parameter to every method in a class, including `__init__`, must be `self`. It refers to **the current object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `self.name` is an attribute. It stores the name. This lets us write `animal('cat')` and get an object with a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç What is `self`?\n",
    "`self` is a special word in Python that refers to the **current object**. When you're inside a class, `self` lets you access that object's data and other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `self` like saying \"this specific object.\" For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def speak(self):\n",
    "    print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "```"

    "# üéÆ Applying OOP to Tic Tac Toe\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a great approach for building games like Tic Tac Toe. Why? Because you have a **state** (the game board, whose turn it is, etc.) and **behavior** (making moves, checking for a winner, drawing the board). It makes sense to bundle these together inside a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÑ Benefits of OOP in a Game:\n",
    "- Easier to **reuse** and **extend** \n",
    "- Keeps **data and behavior together**\n",
    "- Makes code **cleaner and more modular**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instantiating a Game\n",
    "To create a new game object, we instantiate the class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "game = TicTacToe()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we have a live game object (`game`) that we can interact with by calling its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üì¶ Class Structure Overview\n",
    "Here‚Äôs the anatomy of our class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TicTacToe:          # ‚Üê defines the blueprint\n",
    "    def __init__(self):   # ‚Üê constructor that initializes the board\n",
    "        self.board = ...  # ‚Üê attribute storing game state\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "| Component               | Purpose |\n",
    "|-------------------------|---------|\n",
    "| `class TicTacToe:`      | Defines the blueprint. |\n",
    "| `__init__`              | Initializes the game object with a clean board. |\n",
    "| `self`                  | Refers to the current object (like 'this' in other languages). |\n",
    "| Attributes              | Store the game‚Äôs state (e.g., `self.board`). |\n",
    "| Methods                 | Define the game‚Äôs behavior (e.g., `make_move()`, `check_winner()`). |\n",
    "\n",
    "> üß† **Reminder**: Any method inside a class must take `self` as the first argument so it can access that object‚Äôs data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üïπÔ∏è Why Use a Class for This Game?\n",
    "- Groups related logic in one place\n",
    "- Makes the code reusable and extendable \n",
    "- Easier to test and debug\n",
    "- Clean, modular structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÅ Game Flow\n",
    "1. Create the game object:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   game = TicTacToe()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. In a loop:\n",
    "   - Show the board: `game.print_board()`\n",
    "   - Get player move: `game.make_move(...)`\n",
    "   - Let the AI respond: `game.ai_move()`\n",
    "3. After each move:\n",
    "   - Check if there is a winner: `game.check_winner()`\n",
    "   - Or if the game is a draw: `game.is_draw()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let‚Äôs define our class and see each method in action."
